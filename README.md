# Gameboy Color Emulator
This is a gameboy emulator written in Rust just for fun

# How to run it.
Currently you can only run the cpu_instr.gb test rom via:

```code
cargo run --release --bin gbc-emu-egui
```
# Credit
cpu_instr.gb test rom is from [retrio's gb-test-rom](https://github.com/retrio/gb-test-roms)
